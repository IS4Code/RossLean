# GA0006

## Title
Constraint only permits usage of one base bound interface type

## Category
Brevity

## Severity
Warning

## Details
This warning is emitted when a type parameter's type constraints only permit the usage of one base interface type. This is because, logically, that constraint could be safely migrated to the type parameter's constraint clause.

This warning may only be emitted to type parameters that use the `OnlyPermitSpecifiedTypesAttribute` attribute. Not using it (explicitly or implicitly) does not prohibit types that are not explicitly prohibited, thus never fully and decisively restricting the valid type argument set to any base type other than `object`.

## Example
```csharp
class C
<
    // GA0006 will appear here
    [PermittedBaseTypes(typeof(IComparable<int>))]
    [OnlyPermitSpecifiedTypes]
    T
>
{ }
```

In this example, the constraints can be specified in the constraint clause like so:

```csharp
class C<T>
    where T : IComparable<T>
{ }
```

An example where this warning won't be emitted, since the valid type argument set is not restrictible to any base type other than `object`:

```csharp
class C
<
    // GA0006 won't appear here
    [PermittedBaseTypes(typeof(IComparable<int>))]
    T
>
{ }
```
